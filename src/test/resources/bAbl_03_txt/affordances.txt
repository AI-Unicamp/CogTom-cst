# This file presents 'affordances' for each of the entities in he scene.
# Affordances are an entity's properties that show the possible actions users can take with it.
# For example, a Box may contain other objects, and a Ball may be hidden.
# Affordances, for the purpose of this system, are immutable properties during the simulation timeline.
